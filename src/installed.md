# Thank you for installing the Media Downloader Unleashed add-on!

This add-on is a powerful tool that allows you to download files from the web to your device.

## How to use the add-on

1. Open the web page that contains the file you want to download. The add-on icon should turn into a download icon when a file is detected on the page.
2. Click the add-on icon to open the download menu, and start the download!

It's easy!

> üí° Note : Sometimes, the browser does not initialize the add-on before you click on it. If nothing appears in the list, then first open a tab with the add-on, then load your media on the page by refreshing it and re-starting playback, and go back to the add-on page and click "Refresh list".

## FAQ

### ‚ùì There are multiple files, which one do I pick?

The files are sorted chronologically, so the first file is the oldest, and the last file is the most recent. If you just started the media playback, one of the last files is usually the one you want (often `master.m3u8` for streams, or `filename.mp4` for videos).

### ‚ùì There is a bug, how do I report it?

You can report bugs by [creating an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/helloyanis/live-stream-downloader-unleashed/issues) (you will need a GitHub account to do so)
