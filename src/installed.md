# Thank you for installing the Media Downloader Unleashed add-on!

This add-on is a powerful tool that allows you to download files from the web to your device.

## How to use the add-on

1. Open the web page that contains the file you want to download.
2. Click the add-on icon to open the download menu, and start the download!

It's easy!

> 💡 Note : Sometimes, the browser does not initialize the add-on before you click on it. If nothing appears in the list, then first open a tab with the add-on, then load your media on the page by refreshing it and re-starting playback, and go back to the add-on page and click "Refresh list".
