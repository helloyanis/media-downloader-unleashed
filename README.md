A browser add-on to easily download any media (audio, video and streams) played in the browser! *(Not compatible with YouTube)*

## Click the button below to install on Firefox!

### How to install on Chrome, Edge, Chromium, etc...
1. Get the `addon.xpi` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/helloyanis/media-downloader-unleashed/releases) (scroll down for a bit to see it)
2. Rename it to `addon.zip`
3. Sideload it in your browser. See your browser documentation for more info.

It's not on these stores because :
- Chrome web store wants to get a $5 payment for opening the account which is fundamentally incompatible for a non-profit open-source app
- Edge does not want to accept the add-on because it has `background.scripts` which is only used in Manifest Version 2 while this add-on uses manifest version 3, but the new `background.serviceWorker` is not supported yet by Firefox. I have included both for extended compatibility but removing `background.scripts` as Edge asks would break Firefox.

> Note: `*` means partial support. Can download the stream manifest, but not convert to offline video/audio. You can use a third-party tool like ffmpeg to convert the downloaded stream manifest to offline video/audio, or use VLC to play the stream manifest.

- Can change settings to show all requests without filtering if your media is not detected by default.

> Note: Some sites may not work with the add-on due to DRM or other restrictions. If you encounter any issues, please report them on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/helloyanis/media-downloader-unleashed/issues)
